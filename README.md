# SAS Work breakdown structure 


This Python script creates a Gantt chart using the Plotly library, which reflects a project schedule for developing a Robotic Process Automation (RPA) system. The project tasks, their duration, and the roles involved are defined in the script. 

The Gantt chart displays each task along with its start date and end date, and it differentiates between different roles by color-coding them. For example, tasks assigned to the 'Project Manager' are represented by one color, and tasks assigned to 'Developers' by a different color.

The script provides a visual representation of the project timeline, which can be helpful for project management and scheduling.

You can tweak this description as needed depending on the specifics of your script.

## Installation

Describe the installation process. This usually involves:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv # Creates a virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate # Activates the virtual environment
pip install -r requirements.txt # Installs the project dependencies
```

Ensure that you include all the dependencies in the `requirements.txt` file. In this case, we have:

```text
plotly
datetime
```

You might need to include the version numbers of the libraries depending on your code.

## Usage

Describe how to use your script.

```bash
python gantt_chart.py
```
Replace `gantt_chart.py` with the actual name of your Python script.

## Features

Briefly, list what your script can do.
